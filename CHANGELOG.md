## v3.7.4 - 2026-04-08
### 🚀  Improvements

- Added a watchdog for TCP gateway communication in master Modbus mode, with automatic reconnection after   communication loss.
- Monitors the TCP connection to the IP/Wifi gateway and automatically switches between two TCP slots (A→B→A) if no data is received for 2 minutes. 
After 4 consecutive failovers without response, the gateway is declared unreachable and the switching stops. All events are logged at [warn] level in the add-on journal.

### 🐞  Bug Fix
- Fixed invalid MQTT discovery for the `Heating` entity, removing repeated Home Assistant log errors.
    [Issue 83](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/issues/83#issuecomment-4186019644)

### various:
- Bip function updated in preparation for the upcoming premium version.

##  _______________________________________________________

## v3.7.0 - 2026-04-05
### Variable Cell Count Support (1S to 16S) 🥳

- Added major support for variable cell-count battery packs (1S to 16S) 
- The addon now automatically detects the real number of cells reported by the BMS (`cell_count_N`) and adjusts cell voltage calculations accordingly.
- This ensures correct min/max/average/delta values on 4S, 8S, 15S and all other supported configurations up to 16S.

##  _______________________________________________________

## v3.6.15 - 2026-04-02

### 📦 – Enhanced network interface detection
- Enhanced network interface detection for the standalone dashboard URL generation. 

  The flow now automatically finds a valid external IPv4 address instead of relying on a fixed interface name.

### 📦 – Fixed MQTT runtime status
- Fixed MQTT runtime status logging to correctly distinguish `⚠️ disconnected` from `✅ connected` when parsing broker status messages.

Example in the module log:

- 2 Apr 17:04:35 - [warn] [function:MQTT status to HAOS log] ❌ MQTT broker disconnected [MQTT Broker]
- 2 Apr 17:04:48 - [warn] [function:MQTT status to HAOS log] ⚠️ MQTT broker reconnecting [MQTT Broker]
- 2 Apr 17:04:48 - [info] [mqtt-broker:56f7b2737cce493b] Connected to broker: mqtt://core-mosquitto.local.hass.io:1883
- 2 Apr 17:04:48 - [warn] [function:MQTT status to HAOS log] ✅ MQTT broker connected [MQTT Broker]

##  _______________________________________________________

## v3.6.10 - 2026-03-21

### 📦 Changelog – RS485 Polling Interval (non-broadcast mode)
## ✨ New Feature

- Added a new configuration option: 
 ` non_broadcasting_data_interval_s`
 
This allows users to control the polling interval for data interval when broadcasting mode is disabled.


|  🚀 Behavior Summary||
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Mode  | Behavior  |
|  Broadcasting ON |No change   |
| Broadcasting OFF| Data interval = user-defined

⚠️ Notes

- Minimum supported value: 1 seconds
- Maximum supported value: 30 seconds
- Default value: 1 second
Uses dynamic scheduling instead of fixed inject → more flexible & scalable

💡 Why this change

- Avoid hardcoded polling intervals
- Improve performance tuning depending on:   **number of BMS on the RS485 Bus**
- network latency (TCP / RS485 gateway)
- system load (HAOS / Node-RED)

##  _______________________________________________________


## v3.6.6 - 2026-03-16

Introduced a software framer that reconstructs valid JK-BMS frames from raw RS485/TCP streams.

- Cleanly separates:
  - Modbus requests
  - JK-BMS replies
- Handles fragmented and mixed TCP buffers
- Prevents decoder stalls in broadcast mode
- Significantly improves reliability on complex installations

⚠️ **Important change**  
The system is now stricter when parsing frames:
- Invalid or corrupted frames are ignored
- This improves data reliability
- It may also reveal underlying RS485 issues that were previously hidden

👉 If you notice missing data after update, check the new diagnostics panel.

### RS485 Diagnostics & Health Metrics

- Added new topic: `BMS_GLOBAL/health`
- Provides:
  - real-time bus activity
  - framing efficiency
  - communication health status
- Designed to support troubleshooting and large installations

📘 Documentation:  
[Enhanced RS485 troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/blob/main/Documentation/jkbms_rs485_troubleshooting_enhanced.md)

### Stability & Upgrade Safety

- Fixed crashes caused by persisted Node-RED Buffer objects:
  - `{type:"Buffer",data:[...]}`
- Added automatic normalization of restored binary context
- Improved compatibility with Node-RED restarts and updates
- Ensures safe upgrades for long-running systems

### TCP Reconnection Watchdog

Improved reliability when using RS485 over IP gateways:

- Detects absence of data for more than 2 minutes
- Automatically forces TCP reconnect
- Prevents silent connection freezes

Updated parameters:
- `indefiniteRetries: true`
- `maxRetries: 10`
- `retryDelay: 5000ms`

👉 Ensures persistent reconnection in unstable network environments.

## v3.5.5 - 28-01-2026
## ⚡️ Enhancements
### Add Charging Float Mode" switch control

- Charging Float Mode on a JK-BMS is used to manage a float charge once the battery is full.

👉 In concrete terms:

- When the target end-of-charge voltage is reached,

- the BMS cuts off and then temporarily re-authorises charging to maintain the battery at a stable voltage,

- instead of leaving it constantly on charge..

🎯 Main objective:

- avoid overload,

- reduce cell stress,

- improve battery life (especially when stationary).

Issue ![#95](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/issues/95)


### 🐞 Corrections (Bugfix)
The switch created in v3.5.4 did not function correctly in certain situations.

##  _______________________________________________________

## v3.5.4 - 24-01-2026
## ⚡️ Enhancements
#### Addition of an Authorization/Prohibition Switch entity to modify settings

In the Global BMS device, this switch: 
- switch.bms_global_authorize_modify_settings (ON / OFF)

enables/disables the ability to modify BMS settings. 

This is to prevent unwanted and unintended modifications.
This entity acts on all BMS devices.

##  _______________________________________________________

## v3.5.3 - 16-01-2026
## ⚡️ Enhancements
#### Optimisation of the number of alarm messages sent per second

**BEFORE** Over 60 seconds with 2 BMS:  
*30 messages / 60s = 0.5 msg/s EVEN IF NOTHING CHANGES*


**AFTER** optimisation Over 60 seconds with 2 BMS (normal scenario, no alarms): 
*2 messages / 60s = 0.03 msg/s   Reduction: ÷ 15! (from 30 to 2 messages)*

If an alarm appears on a BMS:

*Timeline:
  Overall status OFF → 0 messages
  BMS_2 alarm ON → Aggregation detects: OFF → ON → 1 message 🚨
  Status remains ON   → 0 messages
  BMS_2 alarm OFF → Aggregation detects: ON → OFF → 1 message ✅*

##📈 **TOTAL summary** with all optimisations in versions **v3.5.2 & v3.5.3**
## Final result: **75 msg/s → ~33.5 msg/s (÷ 2.2)** 🎉

The Broker will appreciate this 💪 . 
This will be even more noticeable as the number of BMSs increases.

##Other changes.

Filters added for invalid BMS numbers. Only the following should remain:
BMS_master, BMS_1 to BMS_15

<img width="389" height="249" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6975e234-4126-4221-8713-fa07c81c9d4b" />

##  ____________________________________________________________________


## v3.5.2 - 15-01-2026
## ⚡️ Enhancements

#### Optimisation of the number of topics sent to the MQTT Broker
Indeed, for 2 BMS measured over 60 seconds:

📊 **Before and after comparison**

| Metric | BEFORE (Non-optimised setup) | AFTER Phase 1 (Optimised setup) | Gain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Messages total/60s | ~4600 | 2000 | -57% |
| Overall average | 75-77 msg/s | 33.67 msg/s | ÷ 2.3 |
| BMS_master | 39 msg/s | 17 msg/s | ÷ 2.3 |
| BMS_2 | 37 msg/s | 16.66 msg/s | ÷ 2.2 |

I have reduced the number of setup frames sent. 
They are now only sent when the module starts up and when a setup is modified.
### This results in a **2.3x reduction** in the number of topics sent. 
The broker will appreciate this 👍
Data frames are still sent at a rate of 4 seconds.

##  ____________________________________________________________________


## v3.5.1 - 09-01-2026

### 🐞 Corrections (Bugfix)

[Issue#80](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/issues/80)
# A complete overhaul of the section that processes **TCP/IP gateway** data.

The frames coming from these gateways are poorly ordered, broken or mixed up.

	I had to reconstruct them before processing them for decryption.

#### ⚠️  Normally, no changes should be noticed by those using the USB adapter.

## ⚡️ Enhancements

# 🚨  Alarm management  🚨

Management of the 23 alarms that JK-BMS can trigger.
See DOCS.md file for more information

The module will create sensors automatically in HAOS.
These are:

- ❶ `binary_sensor.bms_x_bms_alarm_active`
- ❷ `sensor.bms_1_bms_1_alarm_list`

These 2 sensors indicate on which BMS there is an alarm and the wording of these alarms. If there is more than one, they are separated by a comma.

A global sensor:

- ❸ `binary_sensor.bms_global_bms_global_alarm`
This is a binary sensor that enables simple automation in the event of an alarm on any BMS.

It was a big, long job, but I think it was worth it.
You tell me.

## 3.1.2

 🐞 Bug fixes --> Incorrect min / max ranges for MQTT number entities

[Issue #29](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/issues/29)

All Home Assistant entities now have appropriate scales.

###  📌 For this to be taken into account !!!
it is **essential to Delete the MQTT device** `BMS_1, BMS_2, BMS_3, etc.`

So that the entities can be recreated with the correct value scales


## 3.1.1

 🐞 Bug fixes

Changed base image amd64 home assistant addon from 'stable' to '18.1.0'.
due to a change in the 'stable' image


## 3.1

## ⚡️ Enhancements

##           🌟  Cloud MQTT Broker support  🌟

Enable secure, encrypted transmission of user-defined JK-BMS entities to a cloud broker such as HiveMQTT.

As a result, this data can be accessed anywhere in the world and on any device that has an MQTT client installed.

For example, on your phone, the ["IoT MQTT Panel"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=snr.lab.iotmqttpanel.prod&hl=en-US) application lets you connect to the Cloud Broker and display the JK-BMS values on your phone in a dashboard defined by you or downloaded from my Ko-Fi.

There's no need to install anything else at home, such as VPNs, proxies (Nginx) or personal plug&play networks like Zerotier or Tailscale.

## To select the entities you wish to export
use the "File editor" addon to modify the `configentities_list.json` file

For a fuller description, You can read the [`HiveMQ-Access.md` ](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/blob/main/HiveMQ-Access.md)on the Github

You can also watch the video explanation on my channel Youtube: [@domosimple](https://www.youtube.com/@domosimple)
## Translations

Fields descriptions in the module configuration automatically take into account the English or French language 😃

## ⚠️ Please, Save your module settings
As the format has changed. You will then need to fill it in again ‼️ ‼️

**Please** also, click on the **"Reset to default"** button on the configuration menu. This will clean up the configuration file and you will be able to define it again with your settings

## Mémory & CPU

I've streamlined the code and installation. Installation is faster and the module less memory-hungry.

## 3.0.13

## ⚡️ Enhancements

Add help to each configuration field.
At the top of each configuration field, there's now an explanation of the purpose of this parameter

 🐞 Bug fixes
No longer calls the TCP/IP gateway if the parameter is set to "false"

## ⚠️ Please, Save your configuration
As the format has changed. You will then need to fill it in again ‼️ ‼️

## 3.0.12

## ⚡️ Enhancements

It is now possible to have the debug option on both the rs485 port and the IP gateway.

⚠️ The `gateway_debug` parameter no longer exists, replaced by `communication_debug`

👀 Please, Don't forget to reset it to "false" once testing is complete. This could unnecessarily overload the module

<img width="680" height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/blob/main/images/Communication-debug.png" />


## 3.0.10

## ⚡️ Enhancements

Added a "debug" option to check whether there is communication via the IP - rs485 gateway. The information can be found in the live module log.

To enable it, change the gateway_debug parameter to "true"
`gateway_debug: true`

⚠️ Don't forget to reset it to "false" once testing is complete.

## 3.0.8

## 🐞 Bug fixes
following the enlightened suggestion of https://github.com/lgrenetier
I have changed "node-red-dashboard": "*", to "node-red-dashboard": "3.6.3"
so that the module can be installed

## 3.0.7
change a timer for the MQTT alive

## 3.0.6

## 🐞 Bug fixes

- Check that MQTT is communicating with the module
I have created a Topic in the MQTT broker to confirm that the module is able to talk to the broker at. This Topic is called **JK-BMS-RS485-CAN-module** and it must be equal to **"Online"**.
You can check this with MQTTExplorer
<img width="680" height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca40210b-f563-45c8-a73f-43a67e05cb32" />


- Checking communication with the BMS:
To check that communication with the BMS is working properly, a log is created in the module's log file. Every 30 seconds you should be able to see this type of text

```
6 Aug 18:42:13 - [warn] [function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-2
6 Aug 18:42:43 - [warn] [function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-1
6 Aug 18:43:13 - [warn] [function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-2
6 Aug 18:43:43 - [warn] [function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-1
```

## 3.0.5

## ⚡️ Enhancements

- Code change for "static" & "setup" frames.
Auto-discovery sent once on module start-up.

Then only the data is sent.
This loads the MQTT broker 10x less. The acquisition time is now set at 4 seconds for 2 BMS.

- Add new topic named **BMS_1/cell_voltage_min_number** which gives the voltage of the lowest cell in the pack



## 3.0.4
Change pickup time

## 3.0.3
Init flow variable

## 3.0.2

## 🐞 Bug fixes
No longer send auto-discovery topics with data frames. Send them just once at startup.
This will relieve the MQTT broker and improve the speed of data updates in HAOS.
This loads the MQTT broker 500x less

## 3.0.1

## ⚡️ Enhancements

**SETUP fields**

Defining the various boudary values for the BMS  **setup** variable

For the various variables, I now define realistic **min** and **max** limits, as well as the **increment/decrement step** and, if necessary, its unit.

## 2.0.0

## ⚡️ Enhancements
Here is the add-on's new functionality in Version 2.0

It is now possible to leave a BMS in Master mode.

This involves setting all 4 small switches to the **down** or **0000** position.
Parameters can no longer be modified in this mode !

In this configuration, the BMS will query the other BMSs if any are connected to the RS485 bus.

The BMS will then broadcast the information it has retrieved cyclically every 5 seconds. This information will be read by this add-on

## 📚 Documentation

Please read the Github [README.md](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/blob/main/README.md)

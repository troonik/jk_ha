# Smartphoton JK-BMS RS485 & CAN Bus Add-on

> **4200+ installations** · **50+ daily clones** · **Community-driven development**

## 🚀 Major Upgrade: Variable Cell Count Support (1S to 16S) - 2026-04-05

The add-on now supports **battery packs with any cell count from 1S to 16S**.

> **No more wrong cell delta values on non-16S packs.**

### ✅ What this improves
- Correct support for **4S, 8S, 15S, 16S** and all other supported pack sizes from **1 to 16 cells**
- Accurate **cell min / max / average / delta** calculations
- Automatic exclusion of **unused cell slots**
- Better dashboard accuracy
- More reliable automations and diagnostics

### Why this matters
Until now, many users with non-16-cell battery packs could see incorrect cell statistics because unused cell slots were still present in the frame layout.  
This new feature makes the addon **cell-count aware**, which is a major improvement for real-world installations.

### Supported BMS Models
- PB2A16S20P / PB2A16S15P
- PB1A16S15P / PB1A16S10P  
- All models with FW:19
- **Variable cell-count battery packs from 1S to 16S**

---

## ⚡ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🆕 **Variable Cell Count Support** | Automatically adapts to battery packs from 1S to 16S using the BMS-reported `cell_count_N` |
| 🎛️ **Full Configuration UI** | Change BMS settings directly from Home Assistant |
| 🔌 **Multiple Connectivity** | RS485 USB, RS485 Ethernet/WiFi Gateway, CAN Bus |
| 📊 **Multi-BMS Support** | Manage up to 15 BMS units simultaneously |
| 🏠 **Native HA Integration** | Control panel integrated into Home Assistant |
| 📡 **MQTT Compatible** | Works with any MQTT-compatible system |
| 🚨 **21 Alarm Types** | Comprehensive alarm management system |

---

## 🚀 Three Operating Modes

### 1️⃣ Master Mode
The add-on queries each BMS (addresses 1-15) via RS485 to retrieve all data.  
**Full control** - modify parameters directly from the software.

✅ Supports packs from **1S to 16S** with automatic cell-count-aware calculations.

```yaml
bms_broadcasting: false
```

### 2️⃣ Listening Mode  
One BMS acts as the RS485 master (DIP switches: 0000).  
**Read-only mode** - ideal when your inverter requires one BMS to be the bus master.

✅ Supports packs from **1S to 16S** with automatic cell-count-aware calculations.

```yaml
bms_broadcasting: true
```

### 3️⃣ CAN Bus Mode *(New! July 2025)*
Direct CAN bus broadcasting via the second RJ45 connector.  
**Loop broadcasting** - autonomous operation.

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `path` | USB port path | `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB_Serial-if00-port0` |
| `nb_jkbms` | Number of BMS units | `1` to `15` |
| `use_gateway` | Using IP gateway? | `true` / `false` |
| `gateway_ip` | Gateway IP address | `192.168.1.100` |
| `gateway_port` | Gateway port | `502` |
| `bms_broadcasting` | Master BMS mode (0000)? | `true` / `false` |
| `mqttaddress` | MQTT broker address | `192.168.1.50` |
| `mqttport` | MQTT broker port | `1883` |
| `mqttuser` | MQTT username | `homeassistant` |
| `mqttpass` | MQTT password (in quotes) | `"your_password"` |

**💡 Pro Tip:** Find your USB path in Settings → System → Hardware → All Hardware (look for ttyUSB)

⚠️ **Compatible USB adapters:** FTDI, CH340, CP2102 chips (ttyUSBx)  
❌ **Not compatible:** Adapters creating ttyACM0 interfaces

---

## 🌐 TCP/IP Gateway Support

Connect your BMS remotely via RS485/Ethernet gateway in transparent mode.  
No need to have your server physically near the batteries!

✅ **Tested gateways:** [View compatible models](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/tree/main/images/Modbus-Gateway)

## 📊 Home Assistant Integration

### MQTT Discovery
BMS units appear automatically as devices in MQTT integration:

![MQTT Devices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/main/images/JKBMS-in-MQTT-devices.png)

### Automatic Cell-Count-Aware Calculations
The add-on automatically reads the real cell count reported by the BMS and adjusts cell analysis accordingly.

This means:
- no more incorrect cell delta values on non-16S packs
- correct min / max / average calculations on 4S, 8S, 15S and other supported pack sizes
- better accuracy for diagnostics, dashboards and automations

### ⛑ Here is a list of all topics that are created automatically.
MQTT Topics Structure - JK-BMS Add-on  
The JK-BMS add-on publishes three categories of data via MQTT:
1. Live Data
2. Configuration Parameters (Settings)
3. Static Specifications

All topics are described in the documentation ![here](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/blob/main/Documentation/mqtt_topics_documentation.md) !

### Rich Entity Set
